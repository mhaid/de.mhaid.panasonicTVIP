# Panasonic TV IP Viera

This app offers an IP remote control for your Panasonic Viera television.

The app has an automatic device search; if it does not detect your device, you can add it manually.

If the MAC address of the TV has been specified in addition to the IP, Homey will search in the background for a change of the IP-Adress of the TV.


For best user experience and stability, a static IP address is recommended. This can be set in the settings of your TV.

Cheers!
